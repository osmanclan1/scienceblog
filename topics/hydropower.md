quiz:
  questions:
    - question: "What is the fundamental principle behind hydropower generation?"
      type: "multiple-choice"
      options:
        - "Converting chemical energy to electrical energy"
        - "Using water's kinetic energy from gravitational potential energy"
        - "Harnessing thermal energy from water"
        - "Extracting energy from water pressure alone"
      correctAnswer: "Using water's kinetic energy from gravitational potential energy"
      explanation: "Hydropower works by positioning water at a height and allowing it to flow downward due to gravity. As the water accelerates, it gains kinetic energy which is then converted to electrical energy."
    - question: "What happens to the magnetic field when the magnets move near the coils?"
      type: "multiple-choice"
      options:
        - "It becomes stronger but remains static"
        - "The static magnetic field turns into a changing magnetic field"
        - "The magnetic field disappears"
        - "The magnetic field reverses direction"
      correctAnswer: "The static magnetic field turns into a changing magnetic field"
      explanation: "When magnets move relative to coils of wire, the previously static magnetic field becomes a changing magnetic field. This changing magnetic field induces an electrical current in the wire coils through electromagnetic induction."
    - question: "In the hydropower formula P = η · ρ · g · h · Q, what does 'head' (h) represent?"
      type: "multiple-choice"
      options:
        - "The volume of water flowing per second"
        - "The vertical distance the water falls"
        - "The efficiency of the turbine"
        - "The density of water"
      correctAnswer: "The vertical distance the water falls"
      explanation: "Head (h) represents the vertical drop or height difference that the water falls. This is a crucial factor because a greater fall means more gravitational potential energy converted to kinetic energy."

# Hydropower

The basic idea behind any technique to extract usable energy is to first convert it from another source. In the case of hydropower, the water's kinetic energy is what we are using as our source.

## The Fundamental Principle

The way this works is if you position a body of water at a height and allow it to flow downward from the natural force of gravity, the water starts to accelerate, carrying with it kinetic energy. Now with any moving mass, it can transfer its kinetic energy to other masses it comes into contact with.

## The Energy Conversion Process

1. **Gravitational Potential to Kinetic Energy**: Water positioned at height has gravitational potential energy. As it flows downward due to gravity, this potential energy converts to kinetic energy.

2. **Kinetic Energy Transfer**: The rapidly flowing water is directed to turbine blades, which causes them to spin. The water transfers its kinetic energy to the mechanical motion of the turbine.

3. **Mechanical to Electrical Energy**: Near these blades, magnets and coils of wire are stationed. When the magnets move (as the turbine spins), the previously static magnetic field turns into a changing magnetic field. This changing magnetic field pushes electrons inside the wires of the coil in one direction, inducing an electrical current which then travels into our electrical grid.

## Power Output Variables

The amount of power you get is a product of two key variables:

- **Head (h)**: How far the body of water falls (more velocity). This is the vertical distance in meters.
- **Flow Rate (Q)**: How much water falls. This is the volume of water passing through per second.

A tiny stream falling from a massive cliff can generate the same power as a massive river moving over a small drop. This demonstrates the trade-off between head and flow rate.

## The Hydropower Formula

The fundamental formula for hydropower is:

$$P = \eta \cdot \rho \cdot g \cdot h \cdot Q$$

### Breaking Down the Variables

- **P (Power)**: Measured in Watts (W). This is the output electrical power.

- **η (Efficiency)**: A coefficient (usually between 0.7 and 0.9) representing energy lost to heat, friction, and sound. In 2026, top-tier turbines reach efficiencies above 95%.

- **ρ (Density)**: The density of water, roughly 1,000 kg/m³. This is the "mass" part of the moving mass principle.

- **g (Gravity)**: The acceleration constant, 9.81 m/s².

- **h (Head)**: The vertical distance the water falls (in meters). This determines how much potential energy is available.

- **Q (Flow Rate)**: The volume of water passing through per second (m³/s). This determines how much water mass is available to transfer energy.

## Summary

Hydropower harnesses the kinetic energy of flowing water, which originates from gravitational potential energy. The water's motion spins turbines, which rotate magnets near wire coils, creating a changing magnetic field that induces electrical current. The power output depends on both the height of the water drop (head) and the volume of water flowing (flow rate), making it possible to generate significant power through various combinations of these two variables.
