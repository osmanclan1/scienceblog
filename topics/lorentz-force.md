The Lorentz force is the force experienced by a charged particle moving through both an electric field and a magnetic field.

## Historical Context

To give you a clearer picture, let's go back to the famous J.J. Thomson's Cathode Ray Tube experiment (1897). In this experiment, there is a glass tube with most of it sucked out—essentially a vacuum. When you apply voltage to the tube, a cathode ray/beam shoots across it glowing brightly.

When Thomson applied an electric field using charged plates, the beam bent towards the positive plate, proving the particles were negatively charged. He also tested what would happen if you were to place current-carrying coils near the tube. Since moving electric charges generate their own magnetic fields, this caused the beam to bend perpendicular to both itself (inital direction of beam) and the magnetic field.

So the Lorentz force is the collective force the electrons in the tube were feeling from both sources in the experiment.

## The Formula

The Lorentz force formula is:

**F = q(E + v × B)**

Where:
- **F** = Force on the charged particle
- **q** = Charge of the particle
- **E** = Electric field
- **v** = Velocity of the particle
- **B** = Magnetic field

The cross product (v × B) means the magnetic force is perpendicular to both the velocity and the magnetic field direction.

## Why is B multiplied with v?

The magnetic component of the Lorentz force depends on the velocity because:
1. Moving charges create magnetic fields
2. The interaction between the moving charge and the external magnetic field is velocity-dependent
3. If the charge is stationary (v = 0), there is no magnetic force, only electric force
4. The faster the charge moves, the stronger the magnetic interaction
